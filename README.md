# Expenses Regulation

> This Ruby on Rails project is about building a mobile web application where user can manage his/her/their budget, having a list of transactions associated with a category, so that user can see how much money is spent and on what. 

Each user has the possibility to:

- get statistics of his/her/their expenses - for all categories at once or for one of them,
- delete any of his/her/their transactions,
- view statistics of his/her/their expenses for any period of time by entering the appropriate dates in the search box on the "All transactions" page.
